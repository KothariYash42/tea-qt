---------------------------------------

+ Functions - Math -  Sum by last column - sums values of each last column at the selection. For example, we can calculate the simply text list:

Carrots 14
Apples 45.8
Oranges 11

   If you want to support TEA via donation, better support the Ukrainian dog shelter Lyubas House - http://www.ukraineanimalrescue.org/#!lyubas-house/cxfj/. There are lot of dogs with disabilities, and they need help more than TEA.

   Stay tuned.
