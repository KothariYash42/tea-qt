  Hi. This release contains misc. fixes and new functions.
  Command lines at Run menu now can use the separated file path parts (macros %fbasename, %ffilename, %fext, %fdir).
  The markup mode has the basic Markdown support.
  English manual fixes by Dr. Tobias Quathamer.
  Many code fixes.

   If you want to support TEA via donation, better support the Ukrainian dog shelter Lyubas House - http://www.ukraineanimalrescue.org/#!lyubas-house/cxfj/. There are lot of dogs with disabilities, and they need help more than TEA.

   Stay tuned.
